made changes to the code provided in the file. "horiseon"
"search engine optimization" link is now working. 
cleaned up the CSS by grouping the repeating lines of code. 
Added alt descriptions to all images. 
Removed </alt> it was not needed
cleaned up alignment. 
commented the sections of the page. 

had a bit of trouble with the assignment. I was trying to see if it was possible to take the side banner and align it with the three middle banners. I tried to put them in the same <div> it did not seem to work. The page looks fine in full screen. When it is shrunk the bottom alignment is off. I tried floats and using the inspect tool but I cannot seem to figure out how to make it work. That is the last thing I was working on with this refator.
